# RLAPSO 
RLAPSO (Reinforcement Learning–Driven Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization) is a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm designed for complex nonlinear parameter estimation problems such as triaxial magnetometer error calibration. Building upon the traditional PSO framework, the algorithm incorporates search state awareness and strategy learning mechanisms to achieve dynamic adaptive adjustment of key control parameters.
